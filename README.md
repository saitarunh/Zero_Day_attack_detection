# Zero_Day_attack_detection
Zero-day attacks exploit unknown vulnerabilities so as to avoid being detected by cybersecurity detection tools. The studies show that zero-day attacks are wide spread and are one of the major threats to computer security. The traditional signature-based detection method is not effective in detecting zero-day attacks as the signatures of zero-day attacks are typically not available beforehand. Machine Learning (ML)-based detection method is capable of capturing attacksâ€™ statistical characteristics and is, hence, promising for zero-day attack detection.
